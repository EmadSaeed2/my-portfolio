- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

-  When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
